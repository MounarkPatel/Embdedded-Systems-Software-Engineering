Code to program an RC car using a MSP430 and make the car fully autonomous.
# What I have done and decided to post so far
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkMhl6mH2F0 . As you can see I used timers, interrupts and Pulse Width Modulation to make a car move forward, reverse, counter clockwise and clockwise.
The LCD display also prints the apporpriate message in accordance to the state the car is in.
